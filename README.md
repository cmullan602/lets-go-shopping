## Description

I created this project as part of my week 14 code bootcamp challenge. The application serves as a backend database for an ecommerce site. Through the application you can add, update and delete to a database that includes products, categories and tags. I thought out of all of the challenges we've done throughout class this one was the easiest. I think that gettting all of the files set up corrrectly can be difficult but they were already provided for us and we just had to refractor the code.
